- It's about learning in a group
- Has teams to work with and give ever users real life experinces on projects
- Basically like hackthebox, codeacademy, and etc but the differece is it's in a team and y'all gotta deadline for almost everything
- The thing I liked the most was implenting the way others go agaisn't each other with like the cyber security side of the things
- Hackers gotta break into something and the offensive gotta stop them or find a way to

Currently the project isn't done yet
